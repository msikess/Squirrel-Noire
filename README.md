Transforming the Java version of the game into Unity PC Build version

*Note: 
1) Still working on setting the game up in Unity, so those files will not be available for a little while;
2) I was not the sole author of the original project. However, both my partner and our Professor gave me permission to publish the original game and to re-implement it in Unity.
